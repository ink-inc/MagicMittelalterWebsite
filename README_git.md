# Commit and branch guidelines

Commits are written in the format: "ACTION: what I have done".
The ACTION is always written in the imperative!
Possible ACTIONS are "ADD", "REMOVE", "UPDATE", "FIX" and "REFACTOR". Some others are possible but there shoulnd't be too many.

Branches are written in the format: "category: feature".
Possible categorys could be "feature", "documentation" or others.
